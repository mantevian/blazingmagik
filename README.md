# blazingmagik
A contrast themed custom dimension datapack for Minecraft Java Edition 1.18.1.

This dimension was made for the Dimensional Competition 3 hosted in the Dimensions Initiative server: https://discord.gg/nW9MXzhrnc

## Biomes
### Amethyst Rainfields
An amethyst themed biome with tall fancy trees that have "raindrops" hanging from them. The surface is covered in pink and magenta concrete and amethysts. Most common animals spawn here.

### amorphous
An unusual looking biome with mostly b&w concrete surface and with floating colored shapes in the air. This biome has a unique property: stepping on gray glazed terracotta launches players up with levitation. Animals don't spawn here, instead, you can meet ghasts and wither skeletons here.

### Artificial Snow Land
A ruined snowy spruce forest. Trees are partly burned, there are patches of ash on the ground. Occasionally you can find fallen meteors on the surface and cages with the last surviving villagers trapped in them, with valuable plants stored in chests.

### crystallized
Consists mostly just of, well, crystals. Those growing up are green and have emerald blocks, those growing down are partly made of obsidian, with rare occurences of diamonds and ancient debris.

### liquated
A swamp/ocean biome. All types of sea creatures spawn here, and prismarine columns spawning underground are a good source of gold and sea lanterns.

### NUCLEAR-STAR
The most dangerous biome. It's an underground biome filled with treasure and weird star-like structures. Players get poison while they're in this biome, and the longer they don't leave it, the stronger the poison. This biome is also a source of blazes.

## Loot Tables
In addition to a chest loot table, pufferfish have 10% chance to drop an Elder Guardian spawn egg and ghasts have a 25% chance to drop a shulker spawn egg.

## Advancements
### Genie
The meteors in Artificial Snow Lands sometimes spawn with soul fire floating in the air. While standing on such placed fire, players levitate (and get fire resistance). Doing this also grants you this advancement.

### The Rumours Were True
Discover a buried villager cage in an Artificial Snow Land. To get this advancement, look at a villager and open a villager cage chest.

### Bufferfish
Obtain an Elder Guardian spawn egg through a rare drop from pufferfish.

### Veteran Chernobylist
Spend 30 minutes in NUCLEAR-STAR without leaving. By this time you will have started being damaged with poison 6 times each 10 seconds.

### Spectacular View From Up Here
Travel 100 blocks vertically and 10 blocks horizontally while levitating. It's a good idea to use the amorphous' effect for this.

### been here yesterday
Discover all 6 biomes from this dimension.
